  |   is every tool of the trade: razor-sharp swords, lethal mixtures,      |
  |   stealthy crossbows, and powerful combat magic. Before you stands a    |

  |   current contract? Tracking down the Child of Prophecy, a living       |
  |   weapon that can alter the shape of the world.                         |
